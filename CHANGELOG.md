## Release 0.7.0

This is the first release assigned a version number.

When downloading weave you now have the following choices...

1. a specific version, e.g. https://github.com/zettio/weave/releases/download/v0.7.0/weave
2. latest released version: https://github.com/zettio/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave
3. most recent 'master' commit: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zettio/weave/master/weave

Previously the only documented download location was (3). We recommend
that any automated scripts using that be changed to either (1) or (2).
